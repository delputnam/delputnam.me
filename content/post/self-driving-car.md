**Q: What's your plan for building a self-driving car?**

**A:** It's an important question. Everyone is building self driving cars. Even Apple is rumored to be building a car which is also expected to be self-driving. <sup>[citation needed]</sup> But while BMW wastes time on things like [cars that automatically drive themselves in circles](http://youtu.be/Ex7BdXXul80) and Google's cars take great care to avoid colliding with other cars, pedestrians, trees, etc., I am taking the "simpler is better" approach:

Step 1: Weld a [cow-catcher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilot_(locomotive) to the front of an SUV.  
Step 2: Hold the steering wheel in place with a bungee cord.  
Step 3: Put a brick on the accelerator.^[Note: Don't forget to point the car in the direction you wanted to go before engaging the brick.]  

I know what you're thinking. Yes, you will likely kill at least one person doing this. Yes, that person may be you. Yes, the car *may* be totalled after each drive. And, yes, there are legal and ethical issues with this sort of thing. But you can't make progress without pushing the boundaries of what's acceptable.

Remember: Rome wasn't built in a day, but it *was* built with bricks^[I know it probably wasn't technically brick. Sheesh, stop being such a stickler for details.] and bungee cords^[There probably weren't technically any bungee cords in Rome. You really shouldn't read this if you want facts.]. And those shields the centurions used were just early forms of cow-catchers. Ha! This is an idea that has been in the making for over two millennia. I've just perfected it.

You're welcome.
