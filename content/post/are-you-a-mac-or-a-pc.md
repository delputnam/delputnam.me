Mac. Definitely a Mac.

Though really only post-NeXTSTEP. While, I used the Apple II and the original Macintosh, it was really OS X that pulled me in. I was never a fan of Windows. It always seemed klunky and poorly conceived.^[I have to admit that the promise of Windows95 fascinated me for a short time before I realized it was just lipstick on a pig.] Before OS X, I really preferred the command line and was pretty much a Linux guy which meant that I cared much more about finding hardware that had a functioning Linux driver available for it.
