title: Predictive Text

Sometimes the predictive text generated by repeatedly pressing the next suggested word makes me think that Apple somehow gets my phone to channel the mind a twelve year-old girl.

Here is an actual conversation where I used predictive text to generate my side of the conversation by just repeatedly selecting one of the next suggested words in a repeating pattern.

And here's the rest of the conversation:

<div class="row">
<div class="alert alert-success col-sm-8 col-xs-10 col-sm-offset-4 right col-xs-offset-2">
	My hair and I love you so much
</div>
<div class="alert alert-primary col-sm-8 col-xs-10">
	I love you and your hair too.
</div>
<div class="alert alert-success col-sm-8 col-xs-10 col-sm-offset-4 right col-xs-offset-2">
	I'm at work on a Friday afternoon with a lot to say
</div>
<div class="alert alert-primary col-sm-8 col-xs-10">
	TGIF?
</div>
<div class="alert alert-success col-sm-8 col-xs-10 col-sm-offset-4 right col-xs-offset-2">
	I don't have the right time
</div>
<div class="alert alert-primary col-sm-8 col-xs-10">
	Maybe an Apple Watch would help?
</div>
<div class="alert alert-success col-sm-8 col-xs-10 col-sm-offset-4 right col-xs-offset-2">
	I don't have to go back to the point of view of a good day for a while to figure out what to do
</div>
<div class="alert alert-primary col-sm-8 col-xs-10">
	Good for you. You know what to do.
</div>
<div class="alert alert-success col-sm-8 col-xs-10 col-sm-offset-4 right col-xs-offset-2">
	I love you too and I love it when people are so cute
</div>
<div class="alert alert-primary col-sm-8 col-xs-10">
	It's a good thing I'm cute.
</div>
<div class="alert alert-success col-sm-8 col-xs-10 col-sm-offset-4 right col-xs-offset-2">
	I love the fact that you are a little more than the first time
</div>
<div class="alert alert-primary col-sm-8 col-xs-10">
	I'm always a little more each time.
</div>
<div class="alert alert-success col-sm-8 col-xs-10 col-sm-offset-4 right col-xs-offset-2">
	The first time I get my nails done with this song on this page is the most recent quarter of the day
</div>
<div class="alert alert-primary col-sm-8 col-xs-10">
	What?  Are you are carrying around sheet music and measuring days in six-hour periods now?
</div>
<div class="alert alert-success col-sm-8 col-xs-10 col-sm-offset-4 right col-xs-offset-2">
	You are so cute when I get my hair done
</div>
<div class="alert alert-primary col-sm-8 col-xs-10">
	So, my cuteness is dependent on you getting your hair done?
</div>
<div class="alert alert-success col-sm-8 col-xs-10 col-sm-offset-4 right col-xs-offset-2">
	I don't know how I feel so good to see my baby girl
</div>
<div class="alert alert-primary col-sm-8 col-xs-10">
	You have a baby?!
</div>
<div class="alert alert-success col-sm-8 col-xs-10 col-sm-offset-4 right col-xs-offset-2">
	The point of view is that I can get the hang of this
</div>
<div class="alert alert-primary col-sm-8 col-xs-10">
	I like your confidence
</div>
<div class="alert alert-success col-sm-8 col-xs-10 col-sm-offset-4 right col-xs-offset-2">
	My mom is the only one of my life
</div>
<div class="alert alert-primary col-sm-8 col-xs-10">
	Maybe you can get more moms in your next life?
</div>
<div class="alert alert-success col-sm-8 col-xs-10 col-sm-offset-4 right col-xs-offset-2">
	The first half of my life is so much better if you have a good first half of my life
</div>
<div class="alert alert-primary col-sm-8 col-xs-10">
	Hmmm. Yes. I think you are right.
</div>
<div class="alert alert-success col-sm-8 col-xs-10 col-sm-offset-4 right col-xs-offset-2">
	The first time I try to get the same thing as the most beautiful thing in life and I don't have a good time waster
</div>
<div class="alert alert-primary col-sm-8 col-xs-10">
	Well, everyone needs a good time waster I guess.
</div>
<div class="alert alert-success col-sm-8 col-xs-10 col-sm-offset-4 right col-xs-offset-2">
	I have no idea how I feel
</div>
<div class="alert alert-primary col-sm-8 col-xs-10">
	I have no idea how you feel either.
</div>
</div>
